# Simple Calculator 🧮

A simple terminal calculator made in C++

## How it works
- Asks the user for the first number to be calculated
- Runs a function to ask what operation they want (+,-,* and /)
- Asks for the second number
- Calculates the result and displays it in the terminal

## What I practiced
- Functions
- Loops for input validation

## Purpose
This project was created as an exercise for learning C++ and programming logic
